# Core values
<br> Before we start, let me share with youth my beliefs 
* Everyone can learn to perform data analytics efficiently (and this is *beyond* programming)
* Data analytics is about story telling, we should aim for objective information, actionable insights, and a thoughtful process (more on this *thoughtful* part later in the series.

# What is this, and what benefits from it?
<br> My plan is to provide the audience of all level a serries of short but practical tutorials for various data science tasks, *step-by-step* and *no step skipped*. 

<br> For example, I will show you how to

* Write a simple R script that plot crimes in Chicago.
* Make a simple bar chart in Excel, and then transform it to another beautiful,actionable plot.
* Write a short program in Stata to execute a repetitive task.

<br> In doing so, I will attempt to show the tutorial in a way that is most accessible to everyone, regardless of your familiarity of the topic in discussion!
