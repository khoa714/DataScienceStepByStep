# Questions & Answers

## What is this, and what benefits from it?
<br> My plan is to provide the audience of all level a serries of short but practical tutorials for various data science tasks, *step-by-step* and *no step skipped*. 

<br> For example, I will show you how to

* Write a simple R script that plot crimes in Chicago.
* Make a simple bar chart in Excel, and then transform it to another beautiful,actionable plot.
* Write a short program in Stata to execute a repetitive task.

<br> In doing so, I will attempt to show the tutorial in a way that is most accessible to everyone, regardless of your familiarity of the topic in discussion!

## Why are you doing this? And Who are you?
<br> I am currently an analyst at a public policy research center at University of Chicago. In my day to day work, we leverage data and our strong relationships with government agencies and community leaders to understand and test the efficacy of social programs. I have helped the city of Chicago in various projects aiming at reducing violence, improving juvenile justice system, and identifying potential programs that provide students with a safe environment to learn and prosper. 

<br> Let me share with you my beliefs about data analytics
* Everyone can learn to perform data analytics efficiently (and this is *beyond* programming)
* Data analytics is about story telling, we should aim for objective information, actionable insights, and a thoughtful process (more on this *thoughtful* part later in the series.
